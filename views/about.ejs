  <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm <strong>Sushant Bhairu Awalekar</strong>, a B.Tech Computer Science student at <strong>TKIET Warananagar</strong>.
    After scoring 56% in my 12th, I committed myself to growth, learning, and skill development. I’ve built a strong foundation
    in programming, full-stack development, and problem-solving through self-driven projects and continuous learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm deeply passionate about <strong>AI, web development, and digital transformation</strong>. I enjoy building tech that makes a real difference.
    My goal is to become a skilled <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> who contributes to meaningful, inclusive, and innovative digital solutions.

    I’m always exploring new technologies, seeking opportunities to grow, and working on projects that challenge my thinking. Whether it’s
